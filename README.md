# Quickstart

## Install truffle globally

`
npm install -g truffle
`

## Download Ganache

Mac: `Ganache-*.dmg`

## Project structure

* contracts/: Directory for Solidity contracts
* migrations/: Directory for scriptable deployment files
* test/: Directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
* truffle.js: Truffle configuration file

### truffle-config.js

This is the configuration file where you can specify the compiler version and the network. We use ganache at the moment which is running at 127.0.0.1:7545

``` js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "*" // Match any network id
    }
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.8.9"
    }
  }
};
```

## Compiling

`
truffle compile
`

## Migrate with Ganache

1. In order to deploy the smart contract to the local blockchain (ganache) run:

    `
    truffle migrate
    `
2. To interact with the contract, you can use the Truffle console. The Truffle console connects to an existing blockchain (in this case, the one generated by Ganache).

    `
    truffle console
    `

    You will see the following prompt:

     `
    truffle(development)>
    `

# How to run 
In order to run the contract:

```bash
cd truffle 
truffle migrate
```

In order to run the client: 
```bash
cd client
yarn start
```
